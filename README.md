## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Implemented Figma designs with code and incorporated responsiveness throughout the site.

## Optimizations

Some future tweaks if time allows:
- Incorporate a frontend framework to reduce unecessary repeating code.
- Pull data from a JSON file rather than hard coding the content.
