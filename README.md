## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Implemented Figma designs with code and incorporated responsiveness using media queries throughout the site.

## Optimizations

Some future tweaks if time allows:
- Incorporate a frontend framework to reduce unecessary repeating code.
- Pull data from a JSON file rather than hard coding the content.

## What I Learned

I learned how to make a website responsive by using media queries which is crucial for a good user experience. Additionally I gained experience translating Figma designs into code which increased my effectiveness to work with designers and turn design concepts into functional web pages.
